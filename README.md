# Atom Config

My [Atom](https://atom.io/) config, feel free to use it. Although realistically, you're probably future Tim trying to setup a computer, thankful that past Tim thought of checking his Atom config into git. You're welcome future Tim.

## Using

Clone the repo:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:smithtimmytim/atom-config.git ~/.atom
```

Use `package-sync` to install the other packages listed in `packages.cson`.
